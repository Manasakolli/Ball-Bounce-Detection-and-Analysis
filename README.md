#Ball Bounce Detection and Analysis

## Real-World Problem
In sports, analyzing the bounce of a ball is crucial for improving performance, assessing technique, and making data-driven decisions. However, there are limited tools available to automate the analysis of ball bounces in sports videos. 

## Solution
This project addresses the problem by developing a **computer vision application** that automatically detects and counts the number of bounces of a ball in a video. The application processes video footage, calculates the total bounce time, and provides insights into the ball's behavior during the game.

### Features:
- **Bounce Detection:** Identifies and counts the number of bounces in a given video.
- **Total Bounce Time:** Calculates and records the total time during which the ball is in contact with the ground.
- **Real-time Video Processing:** Processes video in real-time using OpenCV and NumPy for accurate results.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes the detected bounces on the video, allowing users to see the analysis in action.

## Tech Stack
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library used for real-time computer vision tasks, including video processing and object detection.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing that is used for efficient array handling and mathematical operations.
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the application.
